# Fruit_CNN


The aim of this project is to propose a label of various fruit images. Fruit dataset has been downloaded from the Kaggle. Build the CNN model with Convolutional, pooling and Flatten layer. Adding batch normalization and dropout layer makes simpler model to increase the accuracy and decrease the loss at the same time. Batch Normalization improves the performance and stability during training. Dropout minimize the overfitting of the model. Using those layers and hyper-parameters, Test the classifier and graph the accuracy and loss with 6 optimizers which are adam, sgd, adamax, adagrad, Adadelta, Nadam, and Ftrl
